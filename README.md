## About Me 😄

Hello! I’m Dashinee Parmanum, a bilingual (French and English) Statistics undergraduate at the University of Ottawa, graduating next year. 

Since June 2023, I have been working in IT support at my university, strengthening my customer service and problem-solving skills that help me stay calm and effective under pressure. I’m eager to transition into a full-time data role after graduation.

My technical skills include Python, R, and SQL, complemented by a strong math background. 
My [Data_Projects_Portfolio](https://github.com/DashineePARMANUM/Data_Projects_Portfolio) repository showcases most of my work.

Outside of work and studies, I practiced taekwondo 🥋 for eight years and enjoy reading 📚 as well as thrill-seeking activities like roller coasters 🎢.
