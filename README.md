## About Me ðŸ˜„

Hello! Iâ€™m Dashinee Parmanum, a bilingual (French and English) Statistics undergraduate at the University of Ottawa, graduating in June 2026. 

Since June 2023, I have been working in IT support at my university, strengthening my customer service and problem-solving skills that help me stay calm and effective under pressure. Iâ€™m eager to transition into a full-time data role after graduation.

My technical skills include Python, R, and SQL, complemented by a strong math background. 
My [statistics-projects-summer-2025](https://github.com/DashineePARMANUM/statistics-projects-summer-2025) repository showcases self-directed projects where I apply Excel, SQL, Power BI, R, and Python to solve data problems.

Outside of work and studies, I practiced taekwondo ðŸ¥‹ for eight years and enjoy reading ðŸ“š as well as thrill-seeking activities like roller coasters ðŸŽ¢.
