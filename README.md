## About Me 😄

Hello! I’m Dashinee Parmanum, a bilingual (French and English) Statistics undergraduate student at the University of Ottawa, graduating this year. 

Since June 2023, I have been working in IT support at my university, strengthening my customer service and problem-solving skills that help me stay calm and effective under pressure.   
I’m eager to transition into a full-time data role after graduation.

Tech stack: Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI - backed by strong math/stats foundations.  
My GitHub [Data_Projects_Portfolio](https://github.com/DashineePARMANUM/Data_Projects_Portfolio) features solo + coursework projects applying these tools to real problems.   
For group collaborations (which stayed off GitHub) + detailed write-ups, extra analyses, and certifications, head to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dashinee-parmanum/).

Outside of work and studies, I practiced taekwondo 🥋 for eight years and enjoy reading 📚 as well as thrill-seeking activities like roller coasters 🎢.
