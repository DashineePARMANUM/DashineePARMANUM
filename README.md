## About Me

Hello! I’m Dashinee Parmanum, a Statistics undergraduate at the University of Ottawa, graduating in June 2026. Currently, I work part-time in IT support, where I’ve strengthened my customer service and problem-solving skills—helping me stay calm and effective under pressure. I’m eager to transition into a full-time data role after graduation.

My technical skills include Python, R, and SQL, complemented by a strong math background. My [statistics-projects-summer-2025](https://github.com/DashineePARMANUM/statistics-projects-summer-2025) repository showcases self-directed projects where I apply Excel, SQL, Power BI, R, and Python to solve data problems.

Outside of work and studies, I practiced taekwondo for eight years and enjoy reading as well as thrill-seeking activities like roller coasters.
